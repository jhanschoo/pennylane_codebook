    "Concept: on the other hand, we can apply the **Hadamard transform** (i.e. apply the Hadamard gate to all wires) before applying $U_f$, then Hadamard transform again. Before the latter Hadamard transform, we have inducec a phase change exactly in the component of the state that corresponds to the solution.\n",

    "Then, in the computational basis, the magnitude of each basis component $\\vec{y}$ is given by a summation over all permutations ($\\vec{x}$), where each term contributes $(-1)^{f(\\vec{x})+\\vec{x}\\cdot\\vec{y}}$, and $f$ is an indicator whether $\\vec{x}$ is a solution.\n",

    "Unfortunately, performing the compound transformation wrt distinct solutions results in state vectors whose dot products are $1-4/2^n$; this is their similarity according to cosine similarity, exceedingly so; and moreso the more qubits there are. For $n=1$ the distinct choices in fact result in the same state under different signs. We do indeed have orthogonality when $n=2$."
