    "Recall that in the usual representation of a quantum system in a pure state as a single ket, or a linear combination of kets, a gate acting on the state is represented as $U\\ket{\\psi}$, where $U$ is a linear operator and $\\ket{\\psi}$ represents the pure state.\n",

    "At the end of the day, we need to measure the quantum system for our formalism to have any utility. Let us review measurement on a pure state. A measurement with respect to an observable is represented as a **Hermitian operator**, so it can be represented as a summation $\\sum_k \\lambda_k \\ket{k}\\bra{k}$ where the $\\ket{k}$ are orthonormal. Measurement tells us one of the eigenvalues of the system, and the immediate post-measurement state of the system is the original state projected to the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors having the measured eigenvalue, then renormalized to unit magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "In concrete algebraic terms, we may express the spanned subspace as a sum of component orthonormal basis vectors (renormalized so that the sum is unit); express the pre-measurement state in the same basis, then perform the product. The result is the post-measurement state up to normalization. We perform renormalization up to global phase (which is meaningless) by dividing it with its own magnitude; the magnitude is exactly the root of the probability that the pre-measurement state collapsed to the current one, and is the sum of the squared coefficients that the pre-measurement state has of the basis vectors in the spanned eigenspace.\n",

    "With a mixed state expressed as a weighted sum of states, the probability of our observation is simply the weighted probability with respect to each component (a pure state) of the mixture.\n",
