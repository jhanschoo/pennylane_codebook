    "Suppose that we have a compound mixed state space $A\\otimes B$, with the state represented by a density operator $\\rho_{AB}$. Note that the identity operator is an observable that gives no information and that performs no meaningful wavefunction collapse of the quantum system. Hence we can represent a measurement $O$ on the subsystem $A$ as $O\\otimes I$ in terms of the compound state space. Similarly, we can have transformations $U$ that act solely on $A$ be represented as $U \\otimes I$ in terms of the compound state. It would be useful if we can reduce our density operator to be with respect only to $A$, as long as future operations are not concerned with $B$. Indeed, we can do that. We apply the **partial trace operator** to \"trace out\" $B$. What this involves is finding a separable basis, then summing all components of the basis vectors compound state that have the same component in $A$, ranging over $B$ (taking the expectation over $B$/marginalizing $B$), and so obtain a density operator in terms of the basis of $A$. If the compound state was was a separable pure state, our reduced density operator would represent a pure state. If we had a mixed state or an entangled state, our reduced density operator would represent a mixed state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, this also informs us about going in the other direction. Suppose we have a noisy preparation and obtain a mixed state. Then the formalism allows us to represent this another way; a mixed state can be represented as an entangled pure state with respect to a compound system which we can only observe a subsystem thereof."
