    "Instead, assuming that the $\\ket{\\psi}$ component has positive magnitude, then the orthogonal component should still have some positive mass in the non-solution components, and negative mass in the solution components equal to the mass in the non-solution components. This is because orthogonality is equivalent to the dot product against $\\ket{\\psi}$ being zero, which we can achieve with this. The diffusion component flips this orthogonal vector, so that\n",

    "- A solution component gets its negative mass and more in the orthogonal component, which is flipped back to a positive value and further added to its amplitude in the $\\ket{\\psi}$ component.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for sufficiently low amplitudes in the non-solution components, or negative amplitudes, decomposition requires a negative magnitude in the $\\ket{\\psi}$ component, so that the orthogonal component has sufficient positive amplitude in the non-solution components to cancel out the amplitude in the solution component. Once this happens the absolute amplitudes start to equalize again in magnitude under Grover transforms. In this regime $U_f$ negates the solution vectors, and splitting this result into $\\ket{\\psi}$ component and an orthogonal vector, the $\\ket{\\psi}$ component has negative amplitude, and the orthogonal component contains positive amplitudes in the non-solution components, and negative amplitudes in the solution component. This gets flipped, so summing back together, the non-solution components get more negative amplitude added to them. The solution components have their amplitude split among the $\\ket{\\psi}$ vector and the orthogonal vector; then the orthorganal vector part gets flipped, is greater in magnitude than the $\\ket{\\psi}$ vector part, and so ends up positive with a diminished amplitude in the end."
